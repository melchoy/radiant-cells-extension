# Cells

Radiant Cells Extension allows the use of Cells (http://cells.rubyforge.org/) in radiant sites and extensions

Use Cells as usual inside standard Rails views

Use Cells inside Radiant Layouts & Snippets with <r:cell name="cell_name" view="cell_view" /> 

Cells can be placed in the following locations 
- app/cells in RAILS_ROOT
- app/cells inside any Radiant Extension
- design/cells in RAILS_ROOT (if using file system extension and you want to keep cells near your layouts/snippet)
